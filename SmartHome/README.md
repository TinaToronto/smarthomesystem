Write a smart home appliance control system. The system should be able to control various home appliances such as a Light, Fan, and Air Conditioner. Each appliance has its own unique way of being turned on and off.

Light: The light can be turned off by toggling a switch to the "off" position.
Fan: The fan can be turned off by reducing its speed to zero. 0 = off, 1, and 2.
Air Conditioner: The air conditioner can be turned off by setting the thermostat to the "off" mode. The system will also be updated once a year automatically on January 1st 1:00am local time. The system will turn off all devices for the update. No other actions.
